# ColumbiaUni-Learning-AI-Through-Visualization
This course "Learning AI through Visualization" is taught by Professor Ali at Columbia University. This repo is my daily code development tasks to learn and understand the AI models, Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Course Description
This course offers a comprehensive introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL), with a focus on practical applications. Through a series of structured modules, learners will explore foundational concepts, from understanding datasets to implementing AI models. The course covers optimization techniques, linear regression, and deep learning, emphasizing real-world problem-solving. It includes low-code no-code hands-on coding exercises with interactive dashboards to solidify theoretical concepts, ensuring learners can apply their knowledge to develop AI-driven solutions.

 

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

understand the roles and relationships between artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning, and how each field contributes to modern technological advancements.
understand the importance of dataset specification and model choice, recognizing their impact on AI model performance and decision-making processes.
develop a solid understanding of various optimization routines, including brute-force search, gradient-free methods, and gradient descent, for improving model accuracy.
construct and optimize linear regression models using different approaches such as batch, mini-batch, and stochastic gradient descent, and analyze error functions.
familiarize yourself with major deep learning architectures and activation functions, including ReLU, sigmoid, and softmax, and their use in transforming data.
gain insights of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models, understanding their use in image generation, text completion, and creative applications in AI.
