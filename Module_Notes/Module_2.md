# Module 2

[1] Learn the gradient function. Find the convergence. 

[1.1] Mathematic function to find the gradient in 2 dimentional plains. 

f(x,y) = (x-2)^2 + (y+30)^2 + 10
- Here, pair (x,y) can be (2,-30) to get the convergence. Here we find only one possible pair. 

[1.2] Simillaryly, for a 2 dimentional function to have more than 2 possible convergence points. 

f(x,y) = (x+10)^2 * (y-2)^2 + (x-8)^2 * (y+3)^2 + 10 
- Here pair (x,y) possible values are (-10,-3) and (8,2). These values will make the function converge when take the differentiation.
